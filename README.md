# The Container Problem

The vaccine of Covid-19 can be shipped in large or small containers. Larger containers can hold up to 100 vaccine bottles whereas small containers can hold up to 48 vaccine bottles.

Write a C code (or pseudocode) for a program that reads the number of the vaccine bottles to be shipped then calculates and prints the minimum number of containers needed to ship them all
Note : the large container can only be used if filled 100%

for example: if you have 250 vaccine bottles then you need  2 Large containers and 2 Small containers
